This module contains a helper function to compute photovoltaic savings based on
the logic described by the user. It replicates the corrected calculations for
annual savings with a battery storage system. The function is intentionally
side‑effect free and can be imported into other modules or used directly.

The calculation follows these steps:
1. Compute how much energy is stored in the battery per year by multiplying
   the usable battery capacity (in kWh) by the number of days the battery
   charges. The user uses 300 days as a conservative assumption.
2. Determine the household's remaining annual consumption after subtracting
   the direct daytime consumption covered by the PV system.
3. The battery discharge is the minimum of the remaining consumption and the
   annual stored energy. Any surplus in the battery is considered as energy
   that must be fed into the grid.
4. The feed‑in from the PV system is the remaining PV production after
   subtracting both the direct consumption and the annual battery charge.
5. Savings are calculated on four components: direct consumption, grid
   feed‑in, battery discharge usage and battery surplus feed‑in. These are
   multiplied by either the customer electricity price (€/kWh) or the feed‑in
   tariff (€/kWh).

Example usage is provided in the `__main__` block.
